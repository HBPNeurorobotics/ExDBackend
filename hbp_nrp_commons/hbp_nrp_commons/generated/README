To generate generated_bibi_api or any other Python classes from an XML Schema document, run the following command:

pyxbgen -u <XML Schema document>.xsd -m <name of generated python module>

Example:
    cd $HBP/ExDBackend/hbp_nrp_commons/hbp_nrp_commons/generated
    pyxbgen -u $HBP/Experiments/ExDConfFile.xsd -m exp_conf_api_gen
    pyxbgen -u $HBP/Models/robot_model_configuration.xsd -m robot_conf_api_gen
    pyxbgen -u $HBP/Models/environment_model_configuration.xsd -m environment_conf_api_gen

Attention: the xml schema has to be specified with its file ending, the python module without.

PyXB supports other options, but this suffices for our purposes
